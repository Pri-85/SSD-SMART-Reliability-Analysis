The SSD‑SMART‑Reliability‑Analysis project delivers a complete, reproducible pipeline for generating, processing, and modeling SSD SMART telemetry to study reliability behavior under diverse workload conditions. 
The workflow begins with large‑scale synthetic log generation, followed by structured preprocessing that extracts and normalizes key telemetry fields from the raw directory structure. 
A dedicated inspection stage performs EDA, outlier detection, and feature validation before producing a modeling‑ready dataset. 
The modeling layer includes regression baselines and five hypothesis‑driven experiments that evaluate normalization effects, sensitivity patterns, usage‑failure relationships, Bayesian reliability modeling, and anomaly detection using SVR. All results—plots, metrics, and benchmark outputs—are consolidated in the TestResults folder, while documentation, notebooks, and presentation materials support transparency and academic submission. The repository structure ensures traceability from raw logs to final conclusions, making the project both technically rigorous and business‑relevant for reliability engineering and predictive maintenance workflows.
